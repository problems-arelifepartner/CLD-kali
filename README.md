***Run the Script: Execute the script in your Python environment. Make sure to replace your-project-id with your actual Google Cloud project ID.***

# pkg install openssh

# ssh -i /path/to/your/private/key username@external-ip-address

***Replace /path/to/your/private/key with the path to your SSH key, username with the default username for Kali Linux (usually kali), and external-ip-address with the external IP of your VM.***

# Note
***Make sure to configure firewall rules in GCP to allow SSH access (port 22).
The above script assumes you have the necessary permissions to create resources in your Google Cloud project.
This is a basic setup; you may want to customize the VM configuration further based on your needs.***
